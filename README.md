A magic keyboard

A keyboard on your screen that you can control by showing both your hands into the camera and touching the keys in the air with your index fingers. Once a key has been selected with any index finger you can quickly add a second finger to the same button or letter you want to type to validate your choice of letter that you want to appear on the screen. once two fingers of a hand on a specific key or letter has been detected, the letter will be typed on your screen.

This project has been made in Python with the use of the OpenCV library.
